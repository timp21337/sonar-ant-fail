An illustration of the sonar ant task failing with Debian Ant. 
The same project succeeds with Ant direct from Apache. 

The problem is caused by the logger (logback) failing to find 
an XML parser to read its configuration. 

Tested with:
Sonar 4.4 installed and run with default settings 
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on April 29 2014 (current apache)
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.3 compiled on April 8 2014 (current Ubuntu)
